you can run ML.py ,which is our main code which include data preprocess,data train and data predict.
you can run preprocess.py is the data preprocess code which apply pyspark to speed up.
If you want to try deep learn algorithm we apply,you could choice to run
DL.py which is a encode-decode struct network which include 9 layers we apply.
DL.keras.py apply a GRU which achieve by keras
DL.pytorch.py apply a GRU which achieve by pytorch
you may need a GPU and corresponding pytorch version.
you can also try our pre-train model.
